# xfl_scorigami
Repo for pulling XFL Scores to populate Tableau Scorigami Chart.

Welcome to the XFL Scorigami Repo! Inspired by Jon Bois and https://nflscorigami.com/ , the concept behind this chart is simple: display every score that has happened in the XFL. Using scoring data from https://www.livesport.com/football/usa/xfl/results/, this repo will have the R code used to scrape data that is ultimately fed into a Tableau Public dashboard visualizing all scores.
